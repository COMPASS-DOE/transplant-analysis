# SOIL TRANSPLANT EXPERIMENT

## Understanding the response of coastal forest carbon cycling to changing salinity and moisture content: a soil transplant experiment

**Repository Overview:** This repository is a platform for processing, archiving, and statistically analyzing data associated with the Soil Transplant Experiment located at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.

**Project Overview:** Coastal terrestrial-aquatic interface ecosystems exhibit particular sensitivity to changes in climate and sea level, but the response of soil carbon cycling to changing water availability and salinity remains poorly understood. As a part of a broader COMPASS Program effort to understand coastal ecosystem resilience and responses to future change, this experiment took advantage of natural elevation and salinity gradients at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) in eastern Maryland, USA, to examine how soil processes and structure may change under novel hydrologic regimes.

**Hypotheses:**

**Experimental Design:** Large (40 cm wide x 20 cm deep) soil cores were transplanted in a reciprocal design between plots varying in seawater exposure and elevation above the creek (Figure 1); we monitored the coresâ€™ greenhouse gas fluxes for two years and performed chemical, structural, and biological analyses on the cores.
